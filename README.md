Summary



This project centers on creating machine learning models to assess borrower creditworthiness based on historical lending data. The goal is to categorize loans as either low risk (0) or high risk (1), assisting financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.


Data
The dataset comprises financial information such as loan size, interest rates, borrower income, and debt. The target variable, loan_status, signifies the risk level of the loan:

0: Low risk (75,036 instances) 1: High risk (2,500 instances)

Machine Learning Process
Models evaluated include:

Linear Models: Logistic Regression.

Tree-based Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees.

Kernel-based Model: Support Vector Machine (SVC).

Instance-based Learning: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN).

Ensemble Models: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM.

Results
Accuracy: All models achieved 99% accuracy.

Best Performing Model: LightGBM with an AUC of 0.9947, slightly outperforming XGBoost (0.9942).

Consistency: Models demonstrated strong performance with consistent precision, recall, and F1-scores, indicating effective handling of class imbalance.
